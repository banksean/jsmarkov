    Thank you, Gwen. And I thank the commission, also. I appreciate this privilege of being able 
    to be here and speak with Americans. 
    You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time 
    in America's economy, is go to a kid's soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the 
    sideline and ask them, "How are you feeling about the economy?" 
    And I'll bet you, you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments 
    that some of us have in the stock market. Did we just take a major hit with those investments? 
    Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, 
    perhaps, how we're going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people. 
    The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal 
    government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform 
    to that end. 
    Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John 
    McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded that 
    warning bell. 
    People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn't want to listen to him and wouldn't go towards that 
    reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater 
    oversight, again thanks to John McCain's bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks 
    together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive 
    politics aside and putting the country first. 
    John McCain, in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong, he was talking to 
    and he was talking about the American workforce. And the American workforce is the greatest in this 
    world, with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce. 
    That's a positive. That's encouragement. And that's what John McCain meant. 
    Now, what I've done as a governor and as a mayor is (inaudible) I've had that track record of reform. 
    And I've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain, also, with his track record of 
    reform, where we're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done. 
    Now, Barack Obama, of course, he's pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of 
    his votes have been solely along party line, not having that proof for the American people to know that 
    his commitment, too, is, you know, put the partisanship, put the special interests aside, and get down to 
    getting business done for the people of America. 
    We're tired of the old politics as usual. And that's why, with all due respect, I do respect your years in 
    the U.S. Senate, but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and 
    that new commitment that's going to come with reform. 
    I think that's why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House, and 
    I'm happy to join him there. 
    Darn right it was the predator lenders, who tried to talk Americans into thinking that it was 
    smart to buy a $300,000 house if we could only afford a $100,000 house. There was deception there, and 
    there was greed and there is corruption on Wall Street. And we need to stop that. 
    Again, John McCain and I, that commitment that we have made, and we're going to follow through on 
    that, getting rid of that corruption. 
    One thing that Americans do at this time, also, though, is let's commit ourselves just every day 
    American people, Joe Six Pack, hockey moms across the nation, I think we need to band together and 
    say never again. Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing 
    our money and loaning us these dollars. We need to make sure that we demand from the federal 
    government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need 
    also to not get ourselves in debt. Let's do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first 
    credit card. Don't live outside of our means. We need to make sure that as individuals we're taking 
    personal responsibility through all of this. It's not the American peoples fault that the economy is hurting 
    like it is, but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never 
    again will we be taken advantage of. 
    I would like to respond about the tax increases. We can speak in agreement here that darn right 
    we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here. Now, Barack Obama and Sen. Biden 
    also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history. Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the 
    people's side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction, 94 
    times. 
    Now, that's not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy. We do need the 
    private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce. Government is going to have to 
    learn to be more efficient and live with less if that's what it takes to reign in the government growth that 
    we've seen today. But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late 
    as last year for those families making only $42,000 a year. That's a lot of middle income average 
    American families to increase taxes on them. I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm 
    our economy. 
     I'm still on the tax thing because I want to correct you on that again. And I want to let you 
    know what I did as a mayor and as a governor. And I may not answer the questions that either the 
    moderator or you want to hear, but I'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know 
    my track record also. As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal 
    property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state 
    fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up. Now, as 
    for John McCain's adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher 
    regulations, that is another thing that he is known for though. Look at the tobacco industry. Look at 
    campaign finance reform. 
     I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that 
    seems to be espoused by you. But when you talk about Barack's plan to tax increase affecting only those 
    making $250,000 a year or more, you're forgetting millions of small businesses that are going to fit into 
    that category. So they're going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being 
    created and less productivity. 
    Now you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic. In 
    the middle class of America which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives, that's not patriotic. 
    Patriotic is saying, government, you know, you're not always the solution. In fact, too often you're the 
    problem so, government, lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the 
    private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper. An increased tax formula that Barack 
    Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he's proposing is the 
    backwards way of trying to grow our economy.
     I am because he's got a good health care plan that is detailed. And I want to give you a couple 
    details on that. He's proposing a $5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can 
    purchase their own health care coverage. That's a smart thing to do. That's budget neutral. That doesn't 
    cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obama's plan to mandate health care coverage and 
    have universal government run program and unless you're pleased with the way the federal government 
    has been running anything lately, I don't think that it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to 
    consider health care being taken over by the feds. But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax 
    that's budget neutral. That's going to help. And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states 
    so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if there's a better plan offered somewhere else, 
    we would be able to purchase that. So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that 
    $5,000 tax credit also being offered. 

    Well, the nice thing about running with John McCain is I can assure you he doesn't tell one 
    thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group, including his plans 
    that will make this bailout plan, this rescue plan, even better. 
    I want to go back to the energy plan, though, because this is -- this is an important one that Barack 
    Obama, he voted for in '05. 
    Sen. Biden, you would remember that, in that energy plan that Obama voted for, that's what gave those 
    oil companies those big tax breaks. Your running mate voted for that. 
    You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska? I had to take on those oil companies and tell them, 
    "No," you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of 
    operation, that wasn't going to happen in my state. 
    And that's why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, they're doing what 
    they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but they're not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in 
    Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and 
    we're going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources. 
    And those huge tax breaks aren't coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it 
    adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at 
    the same time. 
    So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies 
    that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own 
    area of expertise, and that's energy.
    There is not. And how long have I been at this, like five weeks? So there hasn't been a whole 
    lot that I've promised, except to do what is right for the American people, put government back on the 
    side of the American people, stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street. 
    And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and 
    deserving. And I don't believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to 
    keep, either. 
     Yes, I would have. But here, again, there have -- there have been so many changes in the 
    conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation 
    made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street. 
    We need to look back, even two years ago, and we need to be appreciative of John McCain's call for 
    reform with Fannie Mae, with Freddie Mac, with the mortgage-lenders, too, who were starting to really 
    kind of rear that head of abuse. 
    And the colleagues in the Senate weren't going to go there with him. So we have John McCain to thank 
    for at least warning people. And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort 
    people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside, even putting a campaign aside, and just do 
    what's right to fix this economic problem that we are in. 
    It is a crisis. It's a toxic mess, really, on Main Street that's affecting Wall Street. And now we have to be 
    ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets don't seize up. That's where the Main Streeters 
    like me, that's where we would really feel the effects. 

    That is not so, but because that's just a quick answer, I want to talk about, again, my record on 
    energy versus your ticket's energy ticket, also. 
    I think that this is important to come back to, with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in 
    '05. 
    When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to 
    become energy independent. 
    It's a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great 
    land. And East Coast politicians who don't allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, 
    to tap into them, and instead we're relying on foreign countries to produce for us. 
     We're circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like 
    America -- they certainly don't have our best interests at heart -- instead of those dollars circulating here, 
    creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start 
    flowing into these very, very hungry markets. 
    Energy independence is the key to this nation's future, to our economic future, and to our national 
    security. So when we talk about energy plans, it's not just about who got a tax break and who didn't. And 
    we're not giving oil companies tax breaks, but it's about a heck of a lot more than that. 
    Energy independence is the key to America's future. 
    Yes. Well, as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels 
    and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state. And we know that it's real. 
    I'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to 
    be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet. 
    But there are real changes going on in our climate. And I don't want to argue about the causes. What I 
    want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts? 
    We have got to clean up this planet. We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us 
    with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that. 
    As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the 
    impacts. We've got to reduce emissions. John McCain is right there with an "all of the above" approach 
    to deal with climate change impacts. 
    We've got to become energy independent for that reason. Also as we rely more and more on other 
    countries that don't care as much about the climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce and to emit 
    and even pollute more than America would ever stand for. 
    So even in dealing with climate change, it's all the more reason that we have an "all of the above" 
    approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum 
    products and our hydrocarbons so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change. 
     Yes, Sen. McCain does support this. The chant is "drill, baby, drill." And that's what we hear 
    all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy 
    to be tapped into. 
    They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds 
    of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas. And we're building a nearly $40 billion natural gas 
    pipeline which is North America's largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow 
    those sources of energy into hungry markets. 
    Barack Obama and Sen. Biden, you've said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the 
    energy crisis that we're in. You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as 
    raping the outer continental shelf. 
    There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do 
    more of that. But also in that "all of the above" approach that Sen. McCain supports, the alternative fuels 
    will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal. 
    I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there isn't anything -- such a thing as 
    clean coal. And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies. 
    I do. I do. 
    Well, not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage 
    between one man and one woman. And unfortunately that's sometimes where those steps lead. 
    But I also want to clarify, if there's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be 
    anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem 
    best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and 
    even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue, some very dear 
    friends who don't agree with me on this issue. 
    But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do 
    anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties. 
    But I will tell Americans straight up that I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one 
    man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually 
    means. 
    But I'm being as straight up with Americans as I can in my non- support for anything but a traditional 
    definition of marriage. 
    Your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his 
    and it is that I do not. 
    : I am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency 
    strategy in Iraq that has proven to work, I am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a 
    great American hero, Gen. Petraeus, and pushed hard by another great American, Sen. John McCain. 
    I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and 
    Afghanistan. Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. 
     And Sen. Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was 
    political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He 
    turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops. We do have a plan for 
    withdrawal. We don't need early withdrawal out of Iraq. We cannot afford to lose there or we're going to 
    be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either. We have got to win in Iraq. 
    And with the surge that has worked we're now down to pre-surge numbers in Iraq. That's where we can 
    be. We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan as we also work with our NATO allies who are 
    there strengthening us and we need to grow our military. We cannot afford to lose against al Qaeda and 
    the Shia extremists who are still there, still fighting us, but we're getting closer and closer to victory. 
    And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq. 
    Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today, 
    that's for sure. And it's not what our nation needs to be able to count on. You guys opposed the surge. 
    The surge worked. Barack Obama still can't admit the surge works. 
    We'll know when we're finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the 
    Iraqi security forces can secure its people. And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those 
    conditions have been met. And Maliki and Talabani also in working with us are knowing again that we 
    are getting closer and closer to that point, that victory that's within sight. 
    Now, you said regarding Sen. McCain's military policies there, Sen. Biden, that you supported a lot of 
    these things. In fact, you said in fact that you wanted to run, you'd be honored to run with him on the 
    ticket. That's an indication I think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the VP 
    pick here. 
    You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief. And I know again that you 
    opposed the move he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that. I don't know 
    how you can defend that position now but I know that you know especially with your son in the 
    National Guard and I have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military. 
    Barack Obama though, another story there. Anyone I think who can cut off funding for the troops after 
    promising not to is another story. 
    Both are extremely dangerous, of course. And as for who coined that central war on terror 
    being in Iraq, it was the Gen. Petraeus and al Qaeda, both leaders there and it's probably the only thing 
    that they're ever going to agree on, but that it was a central war on terror is in Iraq. You don't have to 
    believe me or John McCain on that. I would believe Petraeus and the leader of al Qaeda. 
    An armed, nuclear armed especially Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider. They cannot be allowed 
    to acquire nuclear weapons period. Israel is in jeopardy of course when we're dealing with Ahmadinejad 
    as a leader of Iran. Iran claiming that Israel as he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be 
    wiped off the face of the earth. Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says 
    things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons. 
    Ahmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, the Castro brothers, others who are dangerous dictators are one that Barack 
    Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first. 
    And an issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor 
    judgment. A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous because leaders like Ahmadinejad 
    who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in 
    Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first. 
    No and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially. I had a good conversation with him recently. And he 
    shared with me his passion for diplomacy. And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also. But 
    again, with some of these dictators who hate America and hate what we stand for, with our freedoms, 
    our democracy, our tolerance, our respect for women's rights, those who would try to destroy what we 
    stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as Barack Obama had said he 
    would be willing to do. That is beyond bad judgment. That is dangerous. 
    No, diplomacy is very important. First and foremost, that is what we would engage in. But diplomacy is 
    hard work by serious people. It's lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies 
    ready to back you up there and have sanctions lined up before any kind of presidential summit would 
    take place. 
    A two-state solution is the solution. And Secretary Rice, having recently met with leaders on 
    one side or the other there, also, still in these waning days of the Bush administration, trying to forge 
    that peace, and that needs to be done, and that will be top of an agenda item, also, under a McCain-Palin 
    administration. 
    Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never 
    allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to 
    destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see. 
    We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that 
    we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track 
    record of being able to forge these peace agreements. 
    They succeeded with Jordan. They succeeded with Egypt. I'm sure that we're going to see more success 
    there, also. 
    It's got to be a commitment of the United States of America, though. And I can promise you, in a 
    McCain-Palin administration, that commitment is there to work with our friends in Israel. 
    No, I do not believe that it has been. But I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, 
    and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Sen. Biden. I respect your position on that. 
    No, in fact, when we talk about the Bush administration, there's a time, too, when Americans are going 
    to say, "Enough is enough with your ticket," on constantly looking backwards, and pointing fingers, and 
    doing the blame game. 
    There have been huge blunders in the war. There have been huge blunders throughout this 
    administration, as there are with every administration. 
    But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future, there's just too much finger- 
    pointing backwards to ever make us believe that that's where you're going. 
    Positive change is coming, though. Reform of government is coming. We'll learn from the past mistakes 
    in this administration and other administrations. 
    And we're going to forge ahead with putting government back on the side of the people and making sure 
    that our country comes first, putting obsessive partisanship aside. 
    That's what John McCain has been known for in all these years. He has been the maverick. He has 
    ruffled feathers. 
    But I know, Sen. Biden, you have respected for them that, and I respect you for acknowledging that. But 
    change is coming. 
    Nuclear weaponry, of course, would be the be all, end all of just too many people in too many 
    parts of our planet, so those dangerous regimes, again, cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, 
    period. 
    Our nuclear weaponry here in the U.S. is used as a deterrent. And that's a safe, stable way to use nuclear 
    weaponry. 
    But for those countries -- North Korea, also, under Kim Jong Il -- we have got to make sure that we're 
    putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in 
    this to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong Il and Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire, to 
    proliferate, or to use those nuclear weapons. It is that important. 
    Can we talk about Afghanistan real quick, also, though? 
    OK, I'd like to just really quickly mention there, too, that when you look back and you say that 
    the Bush administration's policy on Afghanistan perhaps would be the same as McCain, and that's not 
    accurate. 
    The surge principles, not the exact strategy, but the surge principles that have worked in Iraq need to be 
    implemented in Afghanistan, also. And that, perhaps, would be a difference with the Bush 
    administration. 
    Now, Barack Obama had said that all we're doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing 
    civilians. And such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause. 
    That's not what we're doing there. We're fighting terrorists, and we're securing democracy, and we're 
    building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country, also. There will be a big 
    difference there, and we will win in -- in Afghanistan, also.
    Well, first, McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in 
    Afghanistan. Certainly, accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are 
    certainly different. We have NATO allies helping us for one and even the geographic differences are 
    huge but the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan. McClellan didn't say anything 
    opposite of that. The counterinsurgency strategy going into Afghanistan, clearing, holding, rebuilding, 
    the civil society and the infrastructure can work in Afghanistan. And those leaders who are over there, 
    who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that. 
    Well, our commanding general did say that. The fact of the matter is that again, I'll just put in 
    perspective, while Barack and I and Chuck Hagel and Dick Lugar have been calling for more money to 
    help in Afghanistan, more troops in Afghanistan, John McCain was saying two years ago quote, "The 
    reason we don't read about Afghanistan anymore in the paper, it's succeeded. 
    Barack Obama was saying we need more troops there. Again, we spend in three weeks on combat 
    missions in Iraq, more than we spent in the entire time we have been in Afghanistan. That will change in 
    a Barack Obama administration. 
    Oh, yeah, it's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider. And someone just not used to the way you 
    guys operate. Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war. You're one who says, as 
    so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice- versa. Americans are craving that 
    straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war 
    resolution. 
    And you had supported John McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had 
    opposed very adamantly Barack Obama's military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops 
    that attempt all through the primary. 
    And I watched those debates, so I remember what those were all about. 
    But as for as Darfur, we can agree on that also, the supported of the no-fly zone, making sure that all 
    options are on the table there also. 
    America is in a position to help. What I've done in my position to help, as the governor of a state that's 
    pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska 
    Permanent Fund. 
    When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for 
    divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we weren't doing anything that would be 
    seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur. That legislation hasn't passed yet but it needs to because 
    all of us, as individuals, and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those 
    atrocities in that region of the world. 
    I beg to disagree with you, again, here on whether you supported Barack Obama or John 
    McCain's strategies. Here again, you can say what you want to say a month out before people are asked 
    to vote on this, but we listened to the debates. 
    I think tomorrow morning, the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and we'll 
    have proof of some of this, but, again, John McCain who knows how to win a war. Who's been there and 
    he's faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here 
    with our military. 
    He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq, especially. He will 
    know how to implement the strategies, working with our commanders and listening to what they have to 
    say, taking the politics out of these war issues. He'll know how to win a war. 
     And heaven forbid, yes, that would ever happen, no matter how this ends up, that that would 
    ever happen with either party. 
    As for disagreeing with John McCain and how our administration would work, what do you expect? A 
    team of mavericks, of course we're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything. As we discuss 
    ANWR there, at least we can agree to disagree on that one. I will keep pushing him on ANWR. I have 
    so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative 
    debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy. 
    What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so 
    committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and 
    corruption on Wall Street and in Washington. 
    I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, D.C. 
    So that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing 
    bureaucracy in the federal government and Congress and inaction of Congress. 
    Just everyday working class Americans saying, you know, government, just get out of my way. If you're 
    going to do any harm and mandate more things on me and take more of my money and income tax and 
    business taxes, you're going to have a choice in just a few weeks here on either supporting a ticket that 
    wants to create jobs and bolster our economy and win the war or you're going to be supporting a ticket 
    that wants to increase taxes, which ultimately kills jobs, and is going to hurt our economy. 
    Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again. You preferenced your whole 
    comment with the Bush administration. Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we 
    have to plan to do for them in the future. You mentioned education and I'm glad you did. I know 
    education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her. Her 
    reward is in heaven, right? I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on 
    that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving. 
    Teachers needed to be paid more. I come from a house full of school teachers. My grandma was, my dad 
    who is in the audience today, he's a schoolteacher, had been for many years. My brother, who I think is 
    the best schoolteacher in the year, and here's a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood 
    Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate. 
    Education credit in American has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit 
    lax and we have got to increase the standards. No Child Left Behind was implemented. It's not doing the 
    job though. We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind. We need to put more of an emphasis on the 
    profession of teaching. We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, 
    absolute top of the line. My kids as public school participants right now, it's near and dear to my heart. 
    I'm very, very concerned about where we're going with education and we have got to ramp it up and put 
    more attention in that arena. 
     In my comment there, it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke, 
    too, I guess, because nobody got it. Of course we know what a vice president does. 
    No, no. Of course, we know what a vice president does. And that's not only to preside over the 
    Senate and will take that position very seriously also. I'm thankful the Constitution would allow a bit 
    more authority given to the vice president if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the 
    Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president's policies and making sure too that our 
    president understands what our strengths are. John McCain and I have had good conversations about 
    where I would lead with his agenda. That is energy independence in America and reform of government 
    over all, and then working with families of children with special needs. That's near and dear to my heart 
    also. In those arenas, John McCain has already tapped me and said, that's where I want you, I want you 
    to lead. I said, I can't wait to get and there go to work with you. 
    Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much 
    flexibility there in the office of the vice president. And we will do what is best for the American people 
    in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the 
    president's agenda in that position. Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, 
    and we'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this 
    nation. And it is my executive experience that is partly to be attributed to my pick as V.P. with McCain, 
    not only as a governor, but earlier on as a mayor, as an oil and gas regulator, as a business owner. It is 
    those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the White House also. 
     My experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil 
    and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state, a huge energy producing state that is accounting 
    for much progress towards getting our nation energy independence and that's extremely important. 
    But it wasn't just that experience tapped into, it was my connection to the heartland of America. Being a 
    mom, one very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to 
    college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills? About times and Todd and our marriage in our past 
    where we didn't have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit 
    around the kitchen table and try to figure out how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care? 
    We've been there also so that connection was important. 
    But even more important is that world view that I share with John McCain. That world view that says 
    that America is a nation of exceptionalism. And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President 
    Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here. We are not 
    perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal. And that is democracy and tolerance and 
    freedom and equal rights. Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good 
    in this world. 
    John McCain and I share that. You combine all that with being a team with the only track record of 
    making a really, a difference in where we've been and reforming, that's a good team, it's a good ticket. 
    People aren't looking for more of the same. They are looking for change. And John McCain has 
    been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years. 
    He's taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party, because he's had to 
    take on his own party when the time was right, when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside 
    and just do what was right for the American people. 
    That's what I've done as governor, also, take on my own party, when I had to, and work with both sides 
    of the aisle, in my cabinet, appointing those who would serve regardless of party, Democrats, 
    independents, Republicans, whatever it took to get the job done. 
    Also, John McCain's maverick position that he's in, that's really prompt up to and indicated by the 
    supporters that he has. Look at Lieberman, and Giuliani, and Romney, and Lingle, and all of us who 
    come from such a diverse background of -- of policy and of partisanship, all coming together at this 
    time, recognizing he is the man that we need to leave -- lead in these next four years, because these are 
    tumultuous times. 
    We have got to win the wars. We have got to get our economy back on track. We have got to not allow 
    the greed and corruption on Wall Street anymore. 
    And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no 
    matter who's been in charge. When the Republicans were in charge, I didn't see a lot of progress there, 
    either. When the Democrats, either, though, this last go- around for the last two years. 
    Change is coming. And John McCain is the leader of that reform. 
    There have been times where, as mayor and governor, we have passed budgets that I did not 
    veto and that I think could be considered as something that I quasi-caved in, if you will, but knowing 
    that it was the right thing to do in order to progress the agenda for that year and to work with the 
    legislative body, that body that actually holds the purse strings. 
    So there were times when I wanted to zero-base budget, and to cut taxes even more, and I didn't have 
    enough support in order to accomplish that. 
    But on the major principle things, no, there hasn't been something that I've had to compromise on, 
    because we've always seemed to find a way to work together. Up there in Alaska, what we have done is, 
    with bipartisan efforts, is work together and, again, not caring who gets the credit for what, as we 
    accomplish things up there. 
    And that's been just a part of the operation that I wanted to participate in. And that's what we're going to 
    do in Washington, D.C., also, bring in both sides together. John McCain is known for doing that, also, in 
    order to get the work done for the American people. 
    You do what I did as governor, and you appoint people regardless of party affiliation, 
    Democrats, independents, Republicans. You -- you walk the walk; you don't just talk the talk. 
    And even in my own family, it's a very diverse family. And we have folks of all political persuasion in 
    there, also, so I've grown up just knowing that, you know, at the end of the day, as long as we're all 
    working together for the greater good, it's going to be OK. 
    But the policies and the proposals have got to speak for themselves, also. And, again, voters on 
    November 4th are going to have that choice to either support a ticket that supports policies that create 
    jobs. 
    You do that by lowering taxes on American workers and on our businesses. And you build up 
    infrastructure, and you rein in government spending, and you make our -- our nation energy 
    independent. 
    Or you support a ticket that supports policies that will kill jobs by increasing taxes. And that's what the 
    track record shows, is a desire to increase taxes, increase spending, a trillion-dollar spending proposal 
    that's on the table. That's going to hurt our country, and saying no to energy independence. Clear choices 
    on November 4th. 
    Well, again, Gwen, I do want to thank you and the commission. This is such an honor for me. 
    And I appreciate, too, Sen. Biden, getting to meet you, finally, also, and getting to debate with you. And 
    I would like more opportunity for this. 
    I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter, even, of the mainstream media kind 
    of telling viewers what they've just heard. I'd rather be able to just speak to the American people like we 
    just did. 
    And it's so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th. 
    I want to assure you that John McCain and I, we're going to fight for America. We're going to fight for 
    the middle-class, average, everyday American family like mine. 
    I've been there. I know what the hurts are. I know what the challenges are. And, thank God, I know what 
    the joys are, too, of living in America. We are so blessed. And I've always been proud to be an 
    American. And so has John McCain. 
    We have to fight for our freedoms, also, economic and our national security freedoms. 
    It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. We 
    don't pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to 
    them so that they shall do the same, or we're going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling 
    our children and our children's children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women 
    were free. 
    We will fight for it, and there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you, and that's 
    Sen. John McCain. 
    Mr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens: I am honored to be considered for the nomination for vice president of the United States.

    I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America.

    I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election against confident opponents at a crucial hour for our country.

    And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges and knows how tough fights are won — the next president of the United States, John S. McCain.

    It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.

    With their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost — there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war.

    But the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.

    They overlooked the caliber of the man himself — the determination, resolve, and sheer guts of Sen. John McCain. The voters knew better.

    And maybe that's because they realize there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first.

    Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.

    He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight.

    And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way.

    Our son Track is 19.

    And one week from tomorrow — Sept. 11 — he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country.

    My nephew Kasey also enlisted and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.

    My family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children.

    In our family, it's two boys and three girls in between — my strong and kind-hearted daughters, Bristol, Willow and Piper.

    And in April, my husband, Todd, and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.

    That's how it is with us.

    Our family has the same ups and downs as any other — the same challenges and the same joys.

    Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.

    And children with special needs inspire a special love.

    To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.

    I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. Todd is a story all by himself.

    He's a lifelong commercial fisherman ... a production operator in the oil fields of Alaska's North Slope ... a proud member of the United Steel Workers Union ... and world champion snow machine racer.

    Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package.

    We met in high school, and two decades and five children later he's still my guy. My mom and dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town.

    And among the many things I owe them is one simple lesson: that this is America, and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity.

    My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath. Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice presidency.

    A writer observed: "We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity, and dignity." I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman.

    I grew up with those people.

    They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America who grow our food, run our factories and fight our wars.

    They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town.

    I was just your average hockey mom and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better.

    When I ran for City Council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too.

    Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown.

    And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves.

    I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a "community organizer," except that you have actual responsibilities. I might add that in small towns, we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.

    We tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco.

    As for my running mate, you can be certain that wherever he goes, and whoever is listening, John McCain is the same man. I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment. And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone.

    But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country. Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons, and not just to mingle with the right people.

    Politics isn't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests.

    The right reason is to challenge the status quo, to serve the common good, and to leave this nation better than we found it.

    No one expects us to agree on everything.

    But we are expected to govern with integrity, good will, clear convictions, and ... a servant's heart.

    I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as vice president of the United States. This was the spirit that brought me to the governor's office, when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau ... when I stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies, and the good-ol' boys network.

    Sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power brokers. That's why true reform is so hard to achieve.

    But with the support of the citizens of Alaska, we shook things up.

    And in short order we put the government of our state back on the side of the people.

    I came to office promising major ethics reform, to end the culture of self-dealing. And today, that ethics reform is the law.

    While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for.

    That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay.

    I also drive myself to work.

    And I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef — although I've got to admit that sometimes my kids sure miss her. I came to office promising to control spending — by request if possible and by veto if necessary.

    Sen. McCain also promises to use the power of veto in defense of the public interest — and as a chief executive, I can assure you it works.

    Our state budget is under control.

    We have a surplus.

    And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending: nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes.

    I suspended the state fuel tax and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.

    I told the Congress "thanks, but no thanks," for that Bridge to Nowhere.

    If our state wanted a bridge, we'd build it ourselves. When oil and gas prices went up dramatically, and filled up the state treasury, I sent a large share of that revenue back where it belonged — directly to the people of Alaska.

    And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, who kind of liked things the way they were, we broke their monopoly on power and resources.

    As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people.

    I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history.

    And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly 40 billion-dollar natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.

    That pipeline, when the last section is laid and its valves are opened, will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart.

    The stakes for our nation could not be higher.

    When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf of Mexico, this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we are forced to draw from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

    And families cannot throw away more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil.

    With Russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus, and to divide and intimidate our European allies by using energy as a weapon, we cannot leave ourselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers.

    To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of world energy supplies ... or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia ... or that Venezuela might shut off its oil deliveries ... we Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas.

    And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska: We've got lots of both.

    Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems — as if we all didn't know that already.

    But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all.

    Starting in January, in a McCain-Palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines ... build more nuclear plants ... create jobs with clean coal ... and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal and other alternative sources.

    We need American energy resources, brought to you by American ingenuity, and produced by American workers. I've noticed a pattern with our opponent.

    Maybe you have, too.

    We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers.

    And there is much to like and admire about our opponent.

    But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform — not even in the state Senate.

    This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting and never use the word "victory" except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed ... when the roar of the crowd fades away ... when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot — what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make government bigger ... take more of your money ... give you more orders from Washington ... and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world. America needs more energy ... our opponent is against producing it.

    Victory in Iraq is finally in sight ... he wants to forfeit.

    Terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay ... he wants to meet them without preconditions.

    Al-Qaida terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America ... he's worried that someone won't read them their rights? Government is too big ... he wants to grow it.

    Congress spends too much ... he promises more.

    Taxes are too high ... he wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific.

    The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars. My sister Heather and her husband have just built a service station that's now opened for business — like millions of others who run small businesses.

    How are they going to be any better off if taxes go up? Or maybe you're trying to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or Ohio ... or create jobs with clean coal from Pennsylvania or West Virginia ... or keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota.

    How are you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the American economy? Here's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election.

    In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers.

    And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.

    They're the ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms, not just on buttons and banners, or on self-designed presidential seals.

    Among politicians, there is the idealism of high-flown speechmaking, in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things.

    And then there is the idealism of those leaders, like John McCain, who actually do great things. They're the ones who are good for more than talk ... the ones we have always been able to count on to serve and defend America. Sen. McCain's record of actual achievement and reform helps explain why so many special interests, lobbyists and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the prospect of a McCain presidency — from the primary election of 2000 to this very day.

    Our nominee doesn't run with the Washington herd.

    He's a man who's there to serve his country, and not just his party.

    A leader who's not looking for a fight, but is not afraid of one either. Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee.

    He said, quote, "I can't stand John McCain." Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man. Clearly what the majority leader was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain. That is only one more reason to take the maverick of the Senate and put him in the White House. My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of "personal discovery." This world of threats and dangers is not just a community, and it doesn't just need an organizer.

    And though both Sen. Obama and Sen. Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote, "fighting for you," let us face the matter squarely.

    There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you ... in places where winning means survival and defeat means death ... and that man is John McCain. In our day, politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of adversity than the nightmare world in which this man, and others equally brave, served and suffered for their country.

    It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a 6-by-4 cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office.

    But if Sen. McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made.

    It's the journey of an upright and honorable man — the kind of fellow whose name you will find on war memorials in small towns across this country, only he was among those who came home.

    To the most powerful office on Earth, he would bring the compassion that comes from having once been powerless ... the wisdom that comes even to the captives, by the grace of God ... the special confidence of those who have seen evil, and seen how evil is overcome. A fellow prisoner of war, a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster, Ohio, recalls looking through a pinhole in his cell door as Lt. Cmdr. John McCain was led down the hallway, by the guards, day after day.

    As the story is told, "When McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations, he would turn toward Moe's door and flash a grin and thumbs up" — as if to say, "We're going to pull through this." My fellow Americans, that is the kind of man America needs to see us through these next four years.

    For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words.

    For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds.

    If character is the measure in this election ... and hope the theme ... and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States.

    Thank you all, and may God bless America.

    I do, Charlie, and on January 20, when John McCain and I are sworn in, if we are so privileged to be elected to serve this country, will be ready. I'm ready. 

    I didn't hesitate, no.

    I -- I answered him yes because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can't blink, you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission, the mission that we're on, reform of this country and victory in the war, you can't blink.

    So I didn't blink then even when asked to run as his running mate.

    But it is about reform of government and it's about putting government back on the side of the people, and that has much to do with foreign policy and national security issues Let me speak specifically about a credential that I do bring to this table, Charlie, and that's with the energy independence that I've been working on for these years as the governor of this state that produces nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of energy, that I worked on as chairman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, overseeing the oil and gas development in our state to produce more for the United States. 

    It is, but I want you to not lose sight of the fact that energy is a foundation of national security. It's that important. It's that significant. 

    Canada, Mexico, and then, yes, that trip, that was the trip of a lifetime to visit our troops in Kuwait and stop and visit our injured soldiers in Germany. That was the trip of a lifetime and it changed my life. 

    There in the state of Alaska, our international trade activities bring in many leaders of other countries. 

    Right, right. 

    Right.

    I have not and I think if you go back in history and if you ask that question of many vice presidents, they may have the same answer that I just gave you. But, Charlie, again, we've got to remember what the desire is in this nation at this time. It is for no more politics as usual and somebody's big, fat resume maybe that shows decades and decades in that Washington establishment, where, yes, they've had opportunities to meet heads of state ... these last couple of weeks ... it has been overwhelming to me that confirmation of the message that Americans are getting sick and tired of that self-dealing and kind of that closed door, good old boy network that has been the Washington elite.

    You know, I don't know if that was my exact quote. 

     But the reference there is a repeat of Abraham Lincoln's words when he said -- first, he suggested never presume to know what God's will is, and I would never presume to know God's will or to speak God's words.

    But what Abraham Lincoln had said, and that's a repeat in my comments, was let us not pray that God is on our side in a war or any other time, but let us pray that we are on God's side.

    That's what that comment was all about, Charlie. And I do believe, though, that this war against extreme Islamic terrorists is the right thing. It's an unfortunate thing, because war is hell and I hate war, and, Charlie, today is the day that I send my first born, my son, my teenage son overseas with his Stryker brigade, 4,000 other wonderful American men and women, to fight for our country, for democracy, for our freedoms.

    Charlie, those are freedoms that too many of us just take for granted. I hate war and I want to see war ended. We end war when we see victory, and we do see victory in sight in Iraq.

    I believe that there is a plan for this world and that plan for this world is for good. I believe that there is great hope and great potential for every country to be able to live and be protected with inalienable rights that I believe are God-given, Charlie, and I believe that those are the rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 

    That, in my world view, is a grand -- the grand plan. 

    I don't know if the task is from God, Charlie. What I know is that my son has made a decision. I am so proud of his independent and strong decision he has made, what he decided to do and serving for the right reasons and serving something greater than himself and not choosing a real easy path where he could be more comfortable and certainly safer. 

    Sure. 

     I do believe unprovoked and we have got to keep our eyes on Russia, under the leadership there. I think it was unfortunate. That manifestation that we saw with that invasion of Georgia shows us some steps backwards that Russia has recently taken away from the race toward a more democratic nation with democratic ideals.That's why we have to keep an eye on Russia.

    And, Charlie, you're in Alaska. We have that very narrow maritime border between the United States, and the 49th state, Alaska, and Russia. They are our next door neighbors.We need to have a good relationship with them. They're very, very important to us and they are our next door neighbor.

    They're our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska. 

    Well, I'm giving you that perspective of how small our world is and how important it is that we work with our allies to keep good relation with all of these countries, especially Russia. We will not repeat a Cold War. We must have good relationship with our allies, pressuring, also, helping us to remind Russia that it's in their benefit, also, a mutually beneficial relationship for us all to be getting along.

    We cannot repeat the Cold War. We are thankful that, under Reagan, we won the Cold War, without a shot fired, also. We've learned lessons from that in our relationship with Russia, previously the Soviet Union.

    We will not repeat a Cold War. We must have good relationship with our allies, pressuring, also, helping us to remind Russia that it's in their benefit, also, a mutually beneficial relationship for us all to be getting along.

    Ukraine, definitely, yes. Yes, and Georgia. 

    Well, you know, the Rose Revolution, the Orange Revolution, those actions have showed us that those democratic nations, I believe, deserve to be in NATO.

    Putin thinks otherwise. Obviously, he thinks otherwise, but...

    Perhaps so. I mean, that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally, is if another country is attacked, you're going to be expected to be called upon and help.

    But NATO, I think, should include Ukraine, definitely, at this point and I think that we need to -- especially with new leadership coming in on January 20, being sworn on, on either ticket, we have got to make sure that we strengthen our allies, our ties with each one of those NATO members.

    We have got to make sure that that is the group that can be counted upon to defend one another in a very dangerous world today.

    What I think is that smaller democratic countries that are invaded by a larger power is something for us to be vigilant against. We have got to be cognizant of what the consequences are if a larger power is able to take over smaller democratic countries. 

    And we have got to be vigilant. We have got to show the support, in this case, for Georgia. The support that we can show is economic sanctions perhaps against Russia, if this is what it leads to.

    It doesn't have to lead to war and it doesn't have to lead, as I said, to a Cold War, but economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, again, counting on our allies to help us do that in this mission of keeping our eye on Russia and Putin and some of his desire to control and to control much more than smaller democratic countries.

    His mission, if it is to control energy supplies, also, coming from and through Russia, that's a dangerous position for our world to be in, if we were to allow that to happen.

    I believe that under the leadership of Ahmadinejad, nuclear weapons in the hands of his government are extremely dangerous to everyone on this globe, yes. 

    No, no. I agree with John McCain that nuclear weapons in the hands of those who would seek to destroy our allies, in this case, we're talking about Israel, we're talking about Ahmadinejad's comment about Israel being the "stinking corpse, should be wiped off the face of the earth," that's atrocious. That's unacceptable. 

    We have got to make sure that these weapons of mass destruction, that nuclear weapons are not given to those hands of Ahmadinejad, not that he would use them, but that he would allow terrorists to be able to use them. So we have got to put the pressure on Iran and we have got to count on our allies to help us, diplomatic pressure. 

    We need to pursue those and we need to implement those. We cannot back off. We cannot just concede that, oh, gee, maybe they're going to have nuclear weapons, what can we do about it. No way, not Americans. We do not have to stand for that. 

    Well, first, we are friends with Israel and I don't think that we should second guess the measures that Israel has to take to defend themselves and for their security. 

    I don't think we can second guess what Israel has to do to secure its nation.

    We cannot second guess the steps that Israel has to take to defend itself. 

    You know, there is a very small percentage of Islamic believers who are extreme and they are violent and they do not believe in American ideals, and they attacked us and now we are at a point here seven years later, on the anniversary, in this post-9/11 world, where we're able to commit to never again. They see that the only option for them is to become a suicide bomber, to get caught up in this evil, in this terror. They need to be provided the hope that all Americans have instilled in us, because we're a democratic, we are a free, and we are a free-thinking society. 

    In what respect, Charlie? 

    His world view. 

    I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is rid this world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are hell bent on destroying our nation. There have been blunders along the way, though. There have been mistakes made. And with new leadership, and that's the beauty of American elections, of course, and democracy, is with new leadership comes opportunity to do things better. 

    I agree that a president's job, when they swear in their oath to uphold our Constitution, their top priority is to defend the United States of America.

    I know that John McCain will do that and I, as his vice president, families we are blessed with that vote of the American people and are elected to serve and are sworn in on January 20, that will be our top priority is to defend the American people.

    Charlie, if there is legitimate and enough intelligence that tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we have every right to defend our country. In fact, the president has the obligation, the duty to defend. 

    Now, as for our right to invade, we're going to work with these countries, building new relationships, working with existing allies, but forging new, also, in order to, Charlie, get to a point in this world where war is not going to be a first option. In fact, war has got to be, a military strike, a last option. 

    In order to stop Islamic extremists, those terrorists who would seek to destroy America and our allies, we must do whatever it takes and we must not blink, Charlie, in making those tough decisions of where we go and even who we target. 

    I believe that America has to exercise all options in order to stop the terrorists who are hell bent on destroying America and our allies. We have got to have all options out there on the table. 

    I see the United States as being a force for good in the world. And as Ronald Reagan used to talk about, America being the beacon of light and hope for those who are seeking democratic values and tolerance and freedom. I see our country being able to represent those things that can be looked to … as that leadership, that light needed across the world.

    I’m not one of those who maybe came from a background of, you know, kids who perhaps graduate college and their parents give them a passport and give them a backpack and say go off and travel the world.No, I’ve worked all my life. In fact, I usually had two jobs all my life until I had kids. I was not a part of, I guess, that culture. The way that I have understood the world is through education, through books, through mediums that have provided me a lot of perspective on the world.
    Because we can’t afford to lose in Afghanistan, as we cannot afford to lose in Iraq, either, these central fronts on the war on terror. And I asked President Karzai, “Is that what you are seeking, also? That strategy that has worked in Iraq that John McCain had pushed for, more troops? A counterinsurgency strategy?” And he said, “yes.” And he also showed great appreciation for what America and American troops are providing in his country.
     I don’t believe that new President Zardari has that mission at all. But no, the Pakistani people also, they want freedom. They want democratic values to be allowed in their country, also. They understand the dangers of terrorists having a stronghold in regions of their country, also. And I believe that they, too, want to rid not only their country, but the world, of violent Islamic terrorists.

    That Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country, Russia, and, on our other side, the land-boundary that we have with Canada. It’s funny that a comment like that was kinda made to … I don’t know, you know … reporters.

    Yeah, mocked, I guess that’s the word, yeah.

    Well, it certainly does, because our, our next-door neighbors are foreign countries, there in the state that I am the executive of. And there…

    We have trade missions back and forth, we do. It’s very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia. As Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America, where do they go? It’s Alaska. It’s just right over the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, Russia, because they are right there, they are right next to our state.

    Specifically, we will make every effort possible to help spread democracy for those who desire freedom, independence, tolerance, respect for equality. That is the whole goal here in fighting terrorism also. It’s not just to keep the people safe, but to be able to usher in democratic values and ideals around this, around the world.

    I think, with Ahmadinejad, personally, he is not one to negotiate with. You can’t just sit down with him with no preconditions being met. Barack Obama is so off-base in his proclamation that he would meet with some of these leaders around our world who would seek to destroy America and that, and without preconditions being met. That’s beyond naïve. And it’s beyond bad judgment. 

    It’s dangerous.

     I’ve never heard Henry Kissinger say, “Yeah, I’ll meet with these leaders without preconditions being met.” Diplomacy is about doing a lot of background work first and shoring up allies and positions and figuring out what sanctions perhaps could be implemented if things weren’t gonna go right. That’s part of diplomacy.

     We shouldn’t second guess Israel’s security efforts because we cannot ever afford to send a message that we would allow a second Holocaust, for one. Israel has got to have the opportunity and the ability to protect itself. They are our closest ally in the Mideast. We need them. They need us. And we shouldn’t second guess their efforts.

     We don’t have to second-guess what their efforts would be if they believe … that it is in their country and their allies, including us, all of our best interests to fight against a regime, especially Iran, who would seek to wipe them off the face of the earth. It is obvious to me who the good guys are in this one and who the bad guys are. The bad guys are the ones who say Israel is a stinking corpse and should be wiped off the face of the earth. That’s not a good guy who is saying that. Now, one who would seek to protect the good guys in this, the leaders of Israel and her friends, her allies, including the United States, in my world, those are the good guys. 

    My understanding is that Rick Davis recused himself from the dealings of the firm. I don't know how long ago, a year or two ago that he's not benefiting from that. And you know, I was - I would hope that's not the case. 

    Again, my understanding is that he recused himself from the dealings with Freddie and Fannie, any lobbying efforts on his part there. And I would hope that's the case because, as John McCain has been saying, and as I've on a much more local level been also rallying against is the undue influence of lobbyists in public policy decisions being made. 

    I'm all about the position that America is in and that we have to look at a $700 billion bailout. And as Sen. McCain has said unless this nearly trillion dollar bailout is what it may end up to be, unless there are amendments in Paulson's proposal, really I don't believe that Americans are going to support this and we will not support this. The interesting thing in the last couple of days that I have seen is that Americans are waiting to see what John McCain will do on this proposal. They're not waiting to see what Barack Obama is going to do. Is he going to do this and see what way the political wind's blowing? They're waiting to see if John McCain will be able to see these amendments implemented in Paulson's proposal.

    He's got the track record of the leadership qualities and the pragmatism that's needed at a crisis time like this. 

    I'm not looking at poll numbers. What I think Americans at the end of the day are going to be able to go back and look at track records and see who's more apt to be talking about solutions and wishing for and hoping for solutions for some opportunity to change, and who's actually done it? 

    Unfortunately, that is the road that America may find itself on. Not necessarily this, as it's been proposed, has to pass or we're going to find ourselves in another Great Depression. But, there has got to be action - bipartisan effort - Congress not pointing fingers at one another but finding the solution to this, taking action, and being serious about the reforms on Wall Street that are needed. 

    That's something that John McCain and I have both been discussing - whether that ... is part of the solution or not. You know, it's going to be a multi-faceted solution that has to be found here. 

    I have not. 

    Oh, well, some decisions that have been made poorly should not be rewarded, of course.

    Consumers - and those who were predator lenders also. That's, you know, that has to be considered also. But again, it's got to be a comprehensive, long-term solution found ... for this problem that America is facing today. As I say, we are getting into crisis mode here.

    I think that the example that you just cited, with his warnings two years ago about Fannie and Freddie - that, that's paramount. That's more than a heck of a lot of other senators and representatives did for us.

    He's also known as the maverick though, taking shots from his own party, and certainly taking shots from the other party. Trying to get people to understand what he's been talking about - the need to reform government.

    I can give you examples of things that John McCain has done, that has shown his foresight, his pragmatism, and his leadership abilities. And that is what America needs today. 

    I'll try to find you some and I'll bring them to you.
